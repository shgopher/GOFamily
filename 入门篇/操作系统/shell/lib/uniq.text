     The uunniiqq utility reads the specified _i_n_p_u_t___f_i_l_e comparing adjacent lines,
     and writes a copy of each unique input line to the _o_u_t_p_u_t___f_i_l_e.  If
     _i_n_p_u_t___f_i_l_e is a single dash (`--') or absent, the standard input is read.
     If _o_u_t_p_u_t___f_i_l_e is absent, standard output is used for output.  The second
     and succeeding copies of identical adjacent input lines are not written.
     Repeated lines in the input will not be detected if they are not adja-
     cent, so it may be necessary to sort the files first.

     The following options are available:

     --cc      Precede each output line with the count of the number of times
             the line occurred in the input, followed by a single space.

     --dd      Only output lines that are repeated in the input.

     --ff _n_u_m  Ignore the first _n_u_m fields in each input line when doing compar-
             isons.  A field is a string of non-blank characters separated
             from adjacent fields by blanks.  Field numbers are one based,
             i.e., the first field is field one.

     --ss _c_h_a_r_s
             Ignore the first _c_h_a_r_s characters in each input line when doing
             comparisons.  If specified in conjunction with the --ff option, the
             first _c_h_a_r_s characters after the first _n_u_m fields will be
             ignored.  Character numbers are one based, i.e., the first char-
             acter is character one.

     --uu      Only output lines that are not repeated in the input.

     --ii      Case insensitive comparison of lines.

     the execution of uunniiqq as described in environ(7).

     The historic ++_n_u_m_b_e_r and --_n_u_m_b_e_r options have been deprecated but are
     still supported in this implementation.
